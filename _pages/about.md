I am a research associate at FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences in Germany working on mathematical statistics. I recently earned my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, under the guidance of [Gerhard Dikta](https://www.fh-aachen.de/en/people/dikta) and [Richard Stockbridge](https://uwm.edu/math/people/stockbridge-richard/). Driven by an ongoing passion for learning, I completed my degree as one of the youngest graduates in the program. This achievement reflects my eagerness to deepen my understanding of complex concepts and my determination to tackle challenging problems --- a mindset that continues to inspire my postdoctoral research and professional growth.

Outside of academia, I enjoy staying active through sports such as beach volleyball, running and acrobatics. These activities not only provide balance to my work but also encourage teamwork, perseverance, and creative problem-solving --- skills that are valuable in both my personal and professional life.

Research
===

In my dissertation, I proposed and theoretically analysed a bootstrap-based goodness-of-fit test for parametric regression. I am currently working on establishing further theoretical properties of the test as well as extending it to more complex settings. Moreover, I am involved in an interdisciplinary project using stochastic optimal control theory for an economic application. In particular, the aim is to optimize the use of different energy sources while ensuring that a predefined carbon budget is not exceeded. 

In my future research, I am eager to explore the mathematical foundations of deep learning, a field where theoretical insights have yet to fully catch up with the rapid empirical advancements. I have already started to engage with foundational literature in this area to broaden my research expertise and identify potential areas for future collaboration and study.
