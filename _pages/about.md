I am a research associate at FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences in Germany working on mathematical statistics. I recently earned my Ph.D. in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, under the guidance of [Gerhard Dikta](https://www.fh-aachen.de/en/people/dikta) and [Richard Stockbridge](https://uwm.edu/math/people/stockbridge-richard/). 

In my dissertation, I proposed and theoretically analysed a bootstrap-based goodness-of-fit test for parametric regression. I am currently working on establishing further theoretical properties of the test as well as extending it to more complex settings. Moreover, I am involved in an interdisciplinary project using stochastic optimal control theory for an economic application. In particular, the aim is to optimize the use of different energy sources while ensuring that a predefined carbon budget is not exceeded. 

In my future research, I am eager to explore the mathematical foundations of deep learning, a field where theoretical insights have yet to fully catch up with the rapid empirical advancements. I have already started to engage with foundational literature in this area to broaden my research expertise and identify potential areas for future collaboration and study.
