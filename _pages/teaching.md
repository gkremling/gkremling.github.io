I have had the opportunity to teach a range of undergraduate and graduate courses, both at FH Aachen University of Applied Sciences (FHA) and University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee (UWM). A detailed list of the classes I have taught is provided below.

In addition to my regular teaching responsibilities, I have also taught two summer courses in Algebra and Precalculus in 2022 as part of the Upward Bound Math & Science (UBMS) program at UWM. This program is dedicated to supporting first-generation college students and those from underrepresented backgrounds in their pursuit of STEM education. In these courses, I designed and delivered engaging lessons to strengthen studentsâ€™ understanding of key mathematical concepts and problem-solving skills, fostering both academic growth and confidence as they prepared for their transition to higher education.
